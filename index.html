          <h4>Module Breakdown:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Digital Design with HDL - 96% - An introduction to digital design
              concepts along with the appropriate role of Hardware Description
              Languages (HDLs) in the modern digital design flow. Particular
              emphasis on using HDLs for the synthesis of digital circuits on
              one side and on the development of appropriate testing through the
              use of HDL test benches and simulation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Algorithms & Numerical Methods - 81% - An introduction to software
              design and implementation, providing solid grounding in the theory
              and applications of data structures and algorithms. The module
              also covers the mathematical theory of numerical methods and their
              applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engineering Mathematics, Signals & Systems - 80% - An inroduction
              to more advanced mathematical tools that are useful for modelling
              real-world engineering systems and for the analysis and processing
              of signals (Multivariable Tools, Laplace transform and Fourier
              Transform).
            </li>
            <li>
              Noise, Waves & Fields - 83% - Provided essential content for the

              introduced transmission line effects on interconnects such as
              delay, reflections, and crosstalk, which are important
              considerations in any high speed digital circuit and in
              transmission of signals over cables. The electromagnetic theory of
              fields and waves is analysed in order to underpin the theory of
              transmission lines and provide the foundations for later courses.
